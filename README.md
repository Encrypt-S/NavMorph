# Polymorph

A site for anonymizing crypto currencies via Changelly's crypto exchange system and NavTech's anonymous NavCoin transactions.  

## Requirements 

This project uses nodejs v8.9.0 and Mongodb.

## Code scaffolding

We use angular cli for creating new components.
Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Run the project

Run `ng build-run` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`.
To rebuild the angular without starting a server, run `ng build`.
To skip rebuilding the angular, run `npm run express`

## Running unit tests

For angular tests, run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
For testing express run `npm run express-test`
For code coverage reports, run `npm run test-coverage` or `npm run express-coverage` for the front end and backend.

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
